# ESG-Investment-Performance-Analysis
This project analyzes the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics and stock performance. Using S&P 500 ESG Risk Ratings combined with historical stock data from major companies (Apple, Tesla, Microsoft) and index benchmarks, the analysis explores whether ESG factors can predict returns and inform effective trading strategies.
Key Research Questions

Do ESG scores correlate with daily/weekly stock returns?
Do high-ESG stocks exhibit different risk-return profiles than low-ESG stocks?
Can machine learning models effectively predict returns using ESG data?
Which ESG components (Environmental, Social, Governance) have the greatest impact on performance?
How do ESG-based trading strategies perform compared to benchmarks?

Key Findings

Minimal correlation between ESG metrics and daily stock returns
High ESG stocks demonstrate slightly lower volatility compared to low ESG stocks
Technical indicators dominate feature importance, with ESG metrics showing limited direct impact on short-term returns
Advanced ML models can achieve RÂ² scores of up to 0.62-0.68 when combining ESG data with technical factors
Buy & Hold strategy outperformed other approaches in backtesting
Monte Carlo simulations reveal significant range of potential outcomes in ESG-focused portfolios
